;;; Commentary:

;;
;; This package is built on top of register.el package and it allows to use registers
;; interactively.
;;
;; Jump interactivelly to the markers stored in the registers.
;;
;; Assuming that there are already stored some points (by means of
;; `point-to-register' or `iregister-point-to-register' command) in the
;; registers. Execute, for example, `iregister-jump-to-next-marker' and the
;; minibuffer will display the snippet of the stored point's buffer. That snippet
;; will contain the text arround of stored point which allows to figure out whether
;; is that right place to be jumped in or not. If yes, then just hit the `RET' and
;; the right buffer will be displayed and the point will be in the same place as it
;; was stored before. If no, then try to hit `n' key or `p' key to view next/previous
;; markers (points) previously stored in the registers. In the meantime, in the
;; minibuffer, you could hit `d' key to delete current point from the register. To
;; quit from the minibuffer press `q' key (or C-g).
;;
;; Optionally you could use `iregister-point-to-register' command from any buffer to
;; store current point to register. That command works exactly as `point-to-register'
;; command but without any prompt, it just finds any empty register and stores there
;; current point.
;;
;; Insert (append/prepend) interactivelly the texts stored in the registers.
;;
;; Assuming that there are already stored some texts (by means of `copy-to-register'
;; or `iregister-copy-to-register' command) in the registers. Execute
;; `iregister-text' and the minibuffer will display the text stored in some
;; register. In the appeared minibuffer you can figure out whether is that right text
;; to be inserted or not. If yes, then just hit the `RET' and the text will be
;; inserted. If no, then try to hit `n' key or `p' key to view next/previous texts
;; previously stored in the registers. In the meantime, in the minibuffer, you could
;; hit `d' key to delete current text from the register. To quit from the minibuffer
;; press `q' key (or C-g). Also you could use `a' key for appending or `A' key for
;; prepending selected text to the current text registry.
;;
;; Optionally you could use `iregister-copy-to-register' command from any buffer to
;; store selected text to a register. That command works exactly as
;; `copy-to-register' command but without any prompt, it just finds any empty
;; register and stores there selected text.
;;

;; Installation:

;; Assuming that the file `iregister.el' is somewhere on the load path, add the
;; following lines to your `.emacs' file:

;; (require 'iregister)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-n") 'iregister-jump-to-next-marker)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-p") 'iregister-jump-to-previous-marker)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-u") 'iregister-point-or-text-to-register)
;;
;; If region is active then `iregister-point-or-text-to-register' command stores a
;; text to any empty register, otherwise it stores a point.

;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-l") 'iregister-text)
;;
;; Change the key bindings to your liking.
