;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a utility for deducing the repository root directory
;; for a given file, based on pre-defined or user provided matching criteria.
;;
;; It is specifically designed to be useful in a heterogeneous environment,
;; where the developer is using several source control tools and types of
;; projects.
;;
;; Once the repository root directory is deduced, it is cached (per buffer) for
;; future reference in subsequent calls to repository-root.
;;
;; In itself this library isn't that useful - it's meant to be used by
;; other libraries that may benefit from knowing where the repository root
;; directory resides (e.g. for limiting search effort).
;;
;; Nested / embedded repositories are also supported, but this feature
;; is disabled by default. Please refer to the documentation of the
;; customization variable `repository-root-exhaustive-scan'.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; 1. Put this file in a directory that is a member of load-path, and
;;    byte-compile it (e.g. with `M-x byte-compile-file') for better
;;    performance.
;; 2. Add the following to your ~/.emacs:
;;    (require 'repository-root)
;; 
;; Usage:
;;
;; 1. add repository root matching criterions to the list repository-root-matchers
;;    either directly:
;;       (add-to-list 'repository-root-matchers repository-root-matcher/git)
;;    or via the repository-root customization group.
;;
;;    you should order the matchers in increasing order of matching likelihood:
;;    the matcher most likely to match should be first on the list.
;;
;; 2. use the function (repository-root path) to find the repository root directory 
;;    corresponding to the given path string - this is the first parent directory
;;    that is matched by at least one criterion in repository-root-matchers.
;;
;; Currently, the following repository root matching criterions are supported:
;; 
;; 1. Pre-defined (built-in) matchers (e.g. repository-root-matcher/git).
;;
;; 2. Rules: a matching rule together with path string snippet. The default
;;    rule is that the path string has to match a file or directory in the repository
;;    root directory, but not in any of the repository's sub-directory.
;;
;; 3. Functions: with two input strings (parent-path-to-test path),
;;    that returns non-nil if parent-path-to-test is the repository root directory
;;    corresponding to the given path string.
;;    If the return value is a string, it is treated as the end-result root directory.
;;    This may be useful if you have your own directory search method.
;;
